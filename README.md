# About this repo
Welcome to the RansomWiper repository, where you could try out "RansomWiper" (in your VMs) and give us feedback about it, you could also get its source code to make it more dangerous than it used to be, but do NOT spread it to the whole world since it could destroy millions of computers.
Code explaination file: Explain.md
# Why I created this malware?
I just wanted to spread awareness about the ever growing problem called Piracy, and how it can be used to spread malware, and how the option of pirating is always available to those who are looking for it, and also why it is worse than buying the software or using the free alternatives.
# What's allowed?
- Try the malware by yourself on a controlled invironment.
- Tweak its code (but do NOT spread it to the world) .
- Use it for EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.
# What's not allowed? 
- Spread it to the internet.

- Use it on your main PC.
- Create a cybercrime with it.
# Where is the program? I can't find it.
As I said, the program will be very dangerous so I won't upload it, but in the meantime, you could get the source code, and build it with `g++`.
