# About this repo
Welcome to the RansomWiper repository, where you could try out "RansomWiper" (in your VMs) and give us feedback about it, you could also get its source code to make it more dangerous than it used to be, but do NOT spread it to the whole world since it could destroy millions of computers.
Code explaination file: Explain.md
# Where is the program? I can't find it
As I said, the program will be very dangerous so I won't upload it, but in the meantime, you could get the source code, and build it with `g++`.
